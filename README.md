# Project-Tailwind-Footer
# Introduction
I was required to apply Tailwind CSS classes to achieve a responsive design and given a reference to replicate.

# Elements included
We started off with a basic HTML starter code that included the basic structure of the footer we then had to style, using Tailwind CSS.

As well as having to design a section for newsletter subscriptions, that included an input field and button.

Designing another section for various links and technology stacks.

And finally, ensuring that the footer was responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

# Reflections
# Challenges Faced 
Tailwind CSS Styling Elements: The difficulty is this area was using the shorthands that I was introduced to, correctly. 

# Areas for Improvement
I would confuse the shorthands a lot, resulting in me needing to restart sections of my code many times, so I would like to work on bettering my understanding of Tailwind CSS.

# Overall Learning Experience
This project helped me realize the many ways of coding more efficiently and effectively with shorthands.
